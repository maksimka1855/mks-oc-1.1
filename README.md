# MKS‑OS 1.1

A simple educational operating system simulator demonstrating basic OS principles.  
*Developed in PyCharm.*

## Description

MKS‑OS 1.1 is a learning project that illustrates elementary mechanisms of operating system operation. The project is designed for studying OS architecture fundamentals and can be used for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

- `source/` — source code of the project (PyCharm project files included);
- `mks-os-1.1.exe` — the executable file of the system.

> **Note**: The executable is pre‑built. You don't need to compile it unless you want to modify the source.

## How to Run

1. Locate the `mks-os-packed.exe` file in the project root.
2. Double‑click the file to start the system.

## Requirements

- **Operating system**: Windows (7/8/10/11);
- **Permissions**: User rights to run executable files;
- **IDE** (for development): PyCharm (recommended) or any Python‑compatible environment.

## Building from Source

To rebuild the project:

1. Open the `source/` directory in **PyCharm**.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (check `requirements.txt` if present).
3. Run the build script (if available) or compile manually via PyCharm's build tools.
4. The new executable will appear in the output folder (typically `dist/` or `bin/`).

> **Tip**: If using PyCharm, use the built‑in terminal for commands.
